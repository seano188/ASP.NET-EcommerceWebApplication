Abraham;1;1;When you think it is useful but drains your computer process like crazy with all the constant background update from various apps
Emily;1;5;Very handy specially when you are on the go and need to transfer files between devices. And the ability to open apps from the cloud is really useful!
Ah Gow;1;4;Makes me very creative!
Esther;2;4;Perfect for drawing UML diagrams! 
Bob;2;5;Visio is very user friendly. Definately recommended!
Ah Gow;2;4;Makes diagraming easy and readable!
Esther;3;4;Amazing software for project management. The only aspect I think can be considered a con is you have to take some time to learn the application. once that is done it is smooth sailing.
Ben;3;5;Very easy to organize and visualize all aspects of your project. It contains many functions for all kind of purposes (tasks, consumables, cost, personnel etc) and it is extremely useful.
Ah Gow;3;3;Can see that it is a very useful app but I have trouble figuring out how to use it!
Abraham;4;5;Didnt find it useful until i got hacked
Peter;4;1;It did not solve the problem. My browser is hacked by ads, and nothing works.
Ah Gow;4;2;Doesn't really help much with preventing malwares and block ads from popping up.
Abraham;5;5;Recommended to my mac friend when i got hacked.
Jennifer;5;5;Excellent! Malwarebytes for Mac is the only Malware program you'll need
Ah Gow;5;3;Good app but too many advertisement for products.
Abraham;6;5;got it together with antivirus when i got hacked
Ah Gow;6;5;Great app! Blocks youtube ads too!
Jennifer;7;2;So hard to learn. I should just use meitu instead.
Ah Gow;7;5;Best creative app so far! Really spark my creative juices
Abraham;7;5;Use it when you need to look prettier
Abraham;8;3;It is hard to use for noobs..@@
Tin;8;5;Good Software to pick up better drawing skills
Ah Gow;8;2;I am lost on how to start
Abraham;9;4;Great product, if only it is cheaper....
Tin;9;5;Bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it!
Ah Gow;9;5;Love the collaboration feature!
